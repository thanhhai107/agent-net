![alt text](./assets/images/nika_arch_gpt.png)

This repository is a unified platform that can offer: 
1. A benchmark suite of curated network incidents that covers 54 realistic network issues, ranging from link and host failures to resource contention, and includes five network scenarios, four of which can be instantiated at different topology sizes, spanning campus and data center networks. By combining these dimensions, the benchmark yields 640 distinct troubleshooting incidents for evaluating AI agents. The benchmark can be further extended by randomizing failure locations and composing multiple issues within a single incident. 
2. A modular plug-and-play orchestration platform that connects AI agents with the network environment, enabling real-time troubleshooting in realistic conditions, and providing a human-facing interface to monitor agent performance.


💡 **Note:** We are actively developing this framework. If you have any suggestions or are interested in contributing, feel free to reach out to us!

<h1 id="📦installation">📦 Installation</h1>

## Requirements

- [Kathará](https://www.kathara.org/). 
  Follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install Kathará.
- Python >= 3.12


## Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies. 
NIKA uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to manage the dependencies. Follow [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install uv. You can also use a standard `pip install -e .` to install the dependencies.

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sands-lab/nika
cd nika

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate the environment
uv venv activate
```

The Kathará API relies on Docker to function properly. We recommend to add current user to docker group to avoid calling with `sudo`. **However, please be aware of the security implications of this action.**

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Login again or activate temporaily with 

```shell
newgrp docker
```

<h1 id="🚀quick-start">🚀 Quick Start</h1>

## Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file under the base directory and set the following environment variables:

```shell
# if use Langsmith for observability
# check langsmith documentation for more details
LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=<>
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<>
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=<>

# if use langfuse for observability
# check langfuse documentation for more details
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = <>
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = <>
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"

# api key for you LLM, e.g. DeepSeek here
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<>

# if use ollama for llm 
OLLAMA_API_URL=<>
```

## Step by step guide
You can follow the steps below to run a complete troubleshooting task with NIKA. Use the `nika` CLI.

Each `nika env run` creates a **session** (printed as `session_id=…`). Session state lives under `runtime/sessions/` and tracks the deployed lab, injected failures, and agent activity. When only one session is running, most commands auto-select it; pass `--session-id` when several sessions are active.

1. **List scenarios and start the network environment**

   ```shell
   nika env list
   nika env run <scenario>                    # scenarios without topology tiers (e.g. simple_bgp)
   nika env run <scenario> -t s             # scalable scenarios (tier: s, m, or l)
   nika env ps                                # running lab instances (grouped by deployed env)
   ```

2. **Inspect and manage sessions**

   ```shell
   nika session ps                            # running sessions (status, failures, agents)
   nika session ps -a                         # include finished sessions
   nika session inspect [SESSION_ID]          # full session JSON + failure summary
   nika session close [SESSION_ID]            # undeploy lab and clear runtime state
   nika session close all -y                  # close every running session
   ```

3. **List problems and inject faults**

   ```shell
   nika failure list
   nika failure describe <problem_id>         # parameter schema and usage hints
   nika failure inject <problem_id> [<problem_id> ...]
   nika failure inject link_down --set device=sw1 --set interface=eth0
   nika failure ps [--session-id ID]          # persisted injection records
   ```

4. **Run commands inside a lab host** (optional debugging)

   ```shell
   nika exec host_1 ip addr show
   nika exec host_1 ping -c 3 10.0.0.2 --timeout 30
   ```

5. **List agent options and run the agent**

   ```shell
   nika agent list
   nika agent run -a react -b openai -m gpt-5-mini -n 20
   nika agent run -a mock -n 5                  # no LLM; useful for pipeline testing
   ```

6. **Evaluate the run** (metrics, judge, session teardown, and CSV summary are separate steps)

   ```shell
   nika eval metrics
   nika eval judge -b openai -m gpt-5-mini
   nika eval publish
   nika eval summary                              # all finished sessions → default CSV
   nika eval summary -p link_down -e simple_bgp   # filter by problem and scenario
   nika eval summary -o results/0_summary/my_run.csv
   ```

Full CLI documentation (benchmark batch mode, traffic types, parameter tables, and conventions) lives in **[src/nika/cli/README.md](src/nika/cli/README.md)**.

### Optional: benchmark or traffic from the CLI

```shell
nika benchmark run
nika benchmark run dc_clos_bgp --problem bgp_asn_misconfig -t s
nika traffic list
nika traffic run od --all-to-host host_1 --mbps 20 --interval 300 --background
```

## Run Unit Tests

```shell
# run all unit tests
uv run --with pytest pytest

# verbose output
uv run --with pytest pytest -v

# run only selected test files
uv run --with pytest pytest tests/test_session.py -v
```

## Network Scenarios

This framework supports multiple network scenarios under the `nika/net_env` directory, including:

| Scenario                                 | Scalable | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data center network (CLOS)               | ✓        | Multi-tier leaf–spine fabric with edge servers.                    |
| Campus network (3-tier)                  | ✓        | Enterprise core–distribution–access topology.                      |
| ISP backbone network (meshed)            | ✓        | Provider-style backbone with core and access nodes.                |
| SDN-enabled cloud POP fabric (CLOS/star) | ✓        | SDN fabric with centralized controller and edge switches.          |
| P4 programmable testbed                  | --       | Compact testbed for data-plane algorithms and pipeline validation. |


💡 More scenarios are WIP!

Each scenario is defined in a Kathará `lab.py` file, which specifies the network topology, devices, and initial configurations. Check [Kathará API Docs](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara/wiki/Kathara-API-Docs) for more details if you want to create your scenarios.

## Network issues

This framework provides a set of predefined issues that can be injected into the network environment. These issues are categorized into different types, each with specific root causes and key signals. By combining the issues with the network scenarios, randomlizing the failure locations, and composing multiple issues, this framework can generate multiple incidents based on a network issue (see # Incident column).
The following table summarizes the issues available in this framework:

| Category                               | Root Cause                              | Key Signals                                                     | # Incident |

Based on the above issues, we disclose a large public dataset of AI agents’ behavior for network troubleshooting, with more than 900 reasoning traces. See the [![Zenodo Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zenodo-17971675-blue?logo=zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/17971675).

## MCP Servers and Tools

This framework provides a set of MCP servers and tools to facilitate network troubleshooting tasks. All servers are available under `src/nika/service/mcp_server`. These include:

- **base mcp server for Kathará**: This server provides the basic functionality for interacting with Kathará network scenarios, including
  - `get_reachability` to check the reachability by pinging all pairs of hosts.
  - `iperf_test` to run iperf test between any two hosts.
  - `systemctl_ops` to manage system services, i.e., start, stop, restart, status.
  - `get_host_net_config` to retrieve the network configuration of a specific host.
  - `nft_list_ruleset` to get the current nftables ruleset.
- **BMv2 mcp server**: This server provides functionality for interacting with BMv2 switches, including
  - `bmv2_get_log` to retrieve the log from a BMv2 switch.
  - `bmv2_get_counter_arrays` to retrieve the counter arrays from a BMv2 switch.
- **Frr mcp server**: This server provides functionality for interacting with FRRouting (FRR), including
  - `frr_get_bgp_conf` to retrieve the BGP configuration from a FRR instance.
  - `frr_get_ospf_conf` to retrieve the OSPF configuration from a FRR instance.
- **INT mcp server**: This server provides functionality for interacting with INT (In-band Network Telemetry) data stored in InfluxDB, including
  - `influx_list_buckets` to list all buckets in InfluxDB.
  - `influx_get_measurements` to retrieve the measurements from a specific bucket in InfluxDB.
  - `influx_query_measurement` to query data from InfluxDB.
- **Generic mcp server**: This server provides generic functionalities, including
  - `google_search` to perform a Google search.
- **Task management mcp server**: This server provides functionality for managing tasks and submissions, including
  - `list_avail_problems` to list all available problems for agent to solve.
  - `get_submission_template` to retrieve the submission template for a specific problem.
  - `submit` to submit a solution for a specific problem.

💡 More tools are coming soon...

You can also plug in your own MCP servers following the configuration instruction. Look for more MCP servers at [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/).

### Plug in the servers to your Claude desktop

#### Windows

Since the network environment and kathará run on Linux, and Claude desktop runs on Windows, we need some tricks here.

1. Modify the `xxx_mcp_server.py` files under `src/nika/service/mcp_server` as follows:
   
```python
mcp = FastMCP(name="kathara_base_mcp_server", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
... # your tools can be kept as is
mcp.run(transport="sse")
```

2. Run the server in VSCode terminal, it will automatically forward the port to Windows host, like 8000 -> 8000.

1. Configure Claude's config file `xx/claude_desktop_config.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kathara_base": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Enjoy!


## Logging and Observability

This framework supports to log and monitor agents with Langfuse, Laminar, and LangSmith, check [Langchain Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/callbacks/) for details.

### Customized Logger

This framework allows users to implement customized logging solutions tailored to their specific needs. This can be achieved by plugging the callback function to `mcp_use.MCPAgent`. For example, 

```python
from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler

class FileLoggerHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        file_handler = logging.FileHandler("mcp_use.log", encoding="utf-8")
        formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s")
        file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
        self.logger.addHandler(file_handler)

    def on_llm_start(self, **kwargs):
        ...

    def on_llm_end(self, **kwargs):
        ...

    def on_tool_start(self,  **kwargs):
        ...

    def on_tool_end(self, **kwargs):
        ...

agent = MCPAgent(
    llm=llm,
    client=client,
    max_steps=max_steps,
    system_prompt_template=system_prompt_template,
    verbose=True,
    callbacks=[FileLoggerHandler()],
