<h1 id="🤖overview">🤖 Overview</h1>

This repository is a unified platform that can offer: 
1. A benchmark suite of curated network incidents that currently registers 55 realistic issue IDs (54 in the compact selected suite), ranging from link and host failures to resource contention, across multiple campus, data-center, SDN, and programmable-data-plane scenarios. The full compatibility matrix yields 640 troubleshooting incidents for evaluating AI agents. The benchmark can be further extended by randomizing failure locations and composing multiple issues within a single incident.
2. A modular plug-and-play orchestration platform that connects AI agents with the network environment, enabling real-time troubleshooting in realistic conditions, and providing a human-facing interface to monitor agent performance.


💡 **Note:** We are actively developing this framework. If you have any suggestions or are interested in contributing, feel free to reach out to us!

<h1 id="📦installation">📦 Installation</h1>

## Requirements

- [Kathará](https://www.kathara.org/). 
  Follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install Kathará.
- Python >= 3.12


## Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies. 
NIKA uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to manage the dependencies. Follow [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install uv. You can also use a standard `pip install -e .` to install the dependencies.

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sands-lab/nika
cd nika

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The Kathará API relies on Docker to function properly. We recommend to add current user to docker group to avoid calling with `sudo`. **However, please be aware of the security implications of this action.**

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Login again or activate temporaily with 

```shell
newgrp docker
```

<h1 id="🚀quick-start">🚀 Quick Start</h1>

## Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, then configure the variables required by the
features you use:

```shell
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434

QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=
QDRANT_COLLECTION=

# Embedding model
EMBEDDING_MODEL=
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1024

LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=

LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

At least one LLM configuration is required for LangChain agents:
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or `OLLAMA_API_URL`. Qdrant and embedding
settings are required only by features that use vector storage. LangSmith and
Langfuse variables are optional observability settings.

## Step by step guide
You can follow the steps below to run a complete troubleshooting task with NIKA. Use the `nika` CLI.

Each `nika env run` creates a **session** (printed as `session_id=…`). Session state lives under `runtime/sessions/` and tracks the deployed lab, injected failures, and agent activity. When only one session is running, most commands auto-select it; pass `--session-id` when several sessions are active.

1. **List scenarios and start the network environment**

   ```shell
   nika env list
   nika env run <scenario>                    # scenarios without topology tiers (e.g. simple_bgp)
   nika env run <scenario> -t s             # scalable scenarios (tier: s, m, or l)
   nika env ps                                # running lab instances (grouped by deployed env)
   ```

2. **Inspect and manage sessions**

   ```shell
   nika session ps                            # running sessions (status, failures, agents)
   nika session ps -a                         # include finished sessions
   nika session inspect [SESSION_ID]          # full session JSON + failure summary
   nika session close [SESSION_ID]            # undeploy lab and clear runtime state
   nika session close all -y                  # close every running session
   ```

3. **List problems and inject faults**

   ```shell
   nika failure list
   nika failure describe <problem_id>         # parameter schema and usage hints
   nika failure inject <problem_id> [<problem_id> ...]
   nika failure inject link_down --set host_name=pc1 --set intf_name=eth0
   nika failure ps [--session-id ID]          # persisted injection records
   ```

4. **Run commands inside a lab host** (optional debugging)

   ```shell
   nika exec pc1 ip addr show
   nika exec pc1 ping -c 3 10.0.0.2 --timeout 30
   ```

5. **List agent options and run the agent**

   ```shell
   nika agent list
   nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b -n 20   # LangGraph + LangChain ReAct
   nika agent run -a cli -m gpt-5.4-mini                    # Codex CLI subprocess worker
   nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b --tool-evolution \
     --tool-library bgp-study --evolution-mode dual
   nika agent run -a cli -m gpt-5.4-mini -e medium        # optional Codex reasoning effort
   nika agent run -a mock -n 5                             # no LLM; useful for pipeline testing
   ```

   See **[Troubleshooting Agents](#troubleshooting-agents)** below for architecture notes and a full walkthrough example.

6. **Close the session, then evaluate the run** (metrics, judge, publish, and CSV summary are separate steps)

   ```shell
   nika session close [SESSION_ID] -y           # undeploy lab and clear runtime state first
   nika eval metrics
   nika eval judge
   nika eval publish
   nika eval summary                              # all finished sessions → default CSV
   nika eval summary -p link_down -e simple_bgp   # filter by problem and scenario
   nika eval summary -o results/0_summary/my_run.csv
   ```

Full CLI documentation (benchmark batch mode, traffic types, parameter tables, and conventions) lives in **[src/nika/codex_cli/README.md](src/nika/codex_cli/README.md)**.

### Visualize a session

Launch the built-in dashboard to inspect topology, injected failures, agent
tool calls, event timelines, submissions, and evaluation metrics:

```shell
nika visualize
nika visualize --session-id <SESSION_ID>
nika visualize --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8501 --no-browser
```

The dashboard reads persisted files under `runtime/sessions/` and `results/`,
so it works for both running and completed sessions.

### Optional: benchmark or traffic from the CLI

```shell
nika benchmark run
nika benchmark run dc_clos_bgp --problem bgp_asn_misconfig -t s
nika benchmark run --judge
nika traffic list
nika traffic run od --all-to-host pc1 --mbps 20 --interval 300 --background
```

## Run Unit Tests

```shell
# run all unit tests
uv run --with pytest pytest

# verbose output
uv run --with pytest pytest -v

# run only selected test files
uv run --with pytest pytest tests/test_session.py -v
```

## Troubleshooting Agents

Agent implementations live under [`src/agent/`](src/agent/). For architecture, directory layout, and extension notes, see **[src/agent/README.md](src/agent/README.md)**.

NIKA ships three LangGraph troubleshooting workflows, a Codex CLI workflow,
and a deterministic mock. Tool Evolution is an optional module applied to a
workflow, not a separate workflow.

| Agent | CLI flag | How it works | Prerequisites |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **ReAct** | `-a react` | LangGraph orchestrates two LangChain ReAct workers (diagnosis → submission) | LLM API key in `.env` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or Ollama URL) |
| **Plan & Execute** | `-a plan-execute` | Structured planner, tool-enabled step executor, and adaptive replanner | Same as ReAct |
| **Reflexion** | `-a reflexion` | Iterative attempt → evaluate → reflect → retry with episodic memory | Same as ReAct |
| **Codex CLI** | `-a cli` | Same two-phase LangGraph flow, but each phase runs `codex exec` as a subprocess with Kathara MCP servers | [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex) installed and authenticated (`codex login` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) |
| **Mock** | `-a mock` | Fixed tool-call script; no LLM | None |

All agents write structured traces to `results/{session_id}/messages.jsonl` and produce `submission.json` via the task MCP server.

### ReAct agent (`-a react`)

```shell
nika agent list
nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b -n 20
nika agent run -a react -b deepseek -m deepseek-chat -n 20
nika agent run -a plan-execute -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b -n 20
nika agent run -a reflexion -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b -n 20 -r 3
nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b --tool-evolution \
  --tool-library experiment-a --evolution-mode dual
nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b \
  --memory-bank bgp-study --memory-mode evolve
```

- **`-b` / `--backend`**: `openai`, `ollama`, `deepseek`, or `netmind`
- **`-m` / `--model`**: model id for the chosen backend
- **`-n` / `--max-steps`**: recursion limit for each tool-enabled worker; for `plan-execute`, also the maximum number of executed plan items
- **`-r` / `--max-attempts`**: maximum number of Reflexion attempts (default `3`; used only by `reflexion`)
- Tracing: Langfuse + LangSmith (configure keys in `.env`)

`plan-execute` uses `planner → executor → replanner` until a diagnosis is
complete or the plan-item limit is reached. `reflexion` implements an iterative
Reflexion loop: each tool-enabled attempt is evaluated against strict evidence,
failed attempts generate compact episodic memory, and the next attempt receives
that memory as strategy guidance. The loop stops on evaluator success or after
`--max-attempts`.

### Tool Evolution module (`--tool-evolution`)

The module can augment `react`, `plan-execute`, or `reflexion` and combines
DRAFT-, TTE-, and Alita-G-inspired mechanisms:

- **DRAFT-like Tool Cards** version agent-facing usage semantics for immutable
  MCP primitives. Post-incident curation groups diverse invocations, contrasts
  successful and failed executions, rewrites preconditions, argument guidance,
  output interpretation, and failure semantics, and records convergence when
  repeated evidence produces no semantic change.
- **TTE-like test-time synthesis** requires the agent to identify a sanitized
  capability gap before constructing an ephemeral workflow. The workflow must
  pass schema, parameterization, composable-primitive allowlist, runtime, and output
  contract checks before it can enter the persistent library as a candidate.
- **Alita-G-like distillation** removes failed and duplicate calls from
  successful traces, shares parameters for repeated concrete values, and
  creates reusable declarative composite tools. The source trajectory is not
  counted as validation evidence.

Nika deliberately synthesizes declarative MCP workflows rather than arbitrary
Python. This preserves actual tool execution while keeping every step within
the composable diagnostic allowlist. Live diagnosis can still use broader
diagnostic tools, but persisted composites exclude open-ended file reads,
traffic generators, unrestricted command arguments, and service/config changes.

```shell
nika benchmark run --csv benchmark/tool_evolution_stream.csv \
  -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b --tool-evolution \
  --tool-library bgp-study --evolution-mode dual

nika tools libraries
nika tools show bgp-study
nika tools reset bgp-study
```

Generated tools start as ephemeral artifacts and become probationary candidates
only after structural, runtime, and semantic verification. With validation
enabled, a candidate is promoted only after successful use in at least two
distinct scenario/topology contexts whose incidents are also solved correctly.
Development and transfer rows retrieve tools but freeze library updates,
preventing held-out leakage.

The library tracks retrieval count, verification reports, utility, and
regression. Capacity defaults to 250 tools and can be changed with
`NIKA_TOOL_LIBRARY_CAPACITY`; overflow is pruned by status and observed utility.

Available ablations are `mastery`, `distill`, `dual`,
`dual-no-validation`, and `dual-no-dedup`. Add `--oracle-routing` only for the
explicit oracle baseline; normal runs select diagnosis servers from public
scenario metadata without consulting the injected problem label.

Tool-Evolving sessions additionally write `tool_evolution.json` and expose
selection recall, argument validity, recovery, reuse, promotion, Tool Card
revisions, capability gaps, verified composites, library health, cross-model
reuse, and sequential efficiency metrics.

### Composable procedural memory

Memory is an optional module composed with `react`, `plan-execute`, or
`reflexion`; it is not a separate workflow. The wrapper retrieves validated
procedural lessons before calling the selected workflow. After `nika eval
metrics` produces detection, localization, and RCA scores, the shared
post-evaluation hook can evolve the same memory bank.

- SQLite + FTS5 under `runtime/memory/` is the canonical typed memory store.
- Qdrant is an optional semantic index; the agent falls back to FTS5 when it is
  unavailable.
- The extractor sees the diagnosis trajectory but never ground-truth text.
- Failed episodes may stage only observations/errors. Fully successful episodes
  can validate learnings; repeated validation promotes them to instructions.
- Each evaluated episode writes `memory_update.json` and
  `memory_snapshot.jsonl` under its result directory.

Online evolution must be sequential:

```shell
nika benchmark run --csv benchmark/benchmark_selected.csv \
  -a react --memory-mode evolve --memory-bank experiment-01 -j 1

nika benchmark run --csv benchmark/benchmark_selected.csv \
  -a plan-execute --memory-mode read --memory-bank experiment-01

nika memory inspect --bank experiment-01
nika memory snapshot --bank experiment-01
nika memory clear --bank experiment-01 -y
```

Retrieval defaults to 20 candidates and injects at most 5 memories within an
estimated 1,500-token budget. Override with `--memory-top-k` and
`--memory-token-budget`.

### Codex CLI agent (`-a cli`)

Requires [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex); follow the [official installation guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart) to install and authenticate.

```shell
# authenticate once
codex login

# run on the current session task
nika agent run -a cli -m gpt-5.4-mini
```

- Uses `codex exec --json` under the hood; reasoning steps stream to the terminal in real time (MCP tool calls, agent messages, turn progress) and are logged to `messages.jsonl`.
- The `-b` backend flag is accepted for CLI parity but ignored — Codex always uses OpenAI models.
- **`-e` / `--reasoning-effort`**: Codex `model_reasoning_effort` (`none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`).
- Per-session Codex workspace: `results/{session_id}/codex_workspace/`

See **[src/nika/codex_cli/README.md](src/nika/codex_cli/README.md)** for full `nika agent` flags and conventions.

### Example: `simple_bgp` with `link_down`

End-to-end workflow from lab deploy through agent run and evaluation:

```shell
# 1. Deploy the network environment (creates a session)
nika env list
nika env run simple_bgp
# → prints session_id=20260613-061340-072e35

# 2. Inspect the fault schema, then inject a link-down on pc1
nika failure describe link_down
nika failure inject link_down --set host_name=pc1 --set intf_name=eth0

# 3. (optional) verify the fault from inside the lab
nika exec pc1 ip link show eth0
nika exec pc2 ping -c 3 195.11.14.2

# 4. Run a troubleshooting agent on the session task
# Option A — LangGraph + LangChain ReAct
nika agent run -a react -b netmind -m openai/gpt-oss-120b -n 20

# Option B — Codex CLI (streams step-by-step output to the terminal)
nika agent run -a cli -m gpt-5.4-mini

# 5. Inspect session state and artifacts
nika session inspect
ls results/<session_id>/
# run.json, ground_truth.json, events.jsonl, messages.jsonl, submission.json, codex_workspace/ (cli only)

# 6. Close the lab, then evaluate
nika session close -y
nika eval metrics
nika eval judge
nika eval publish
```

When multiple sessions are running, pass `--session-id <id>` to `failure inject`, `agent run`, and other session-scoped commands.

💡 More scenarios are WIP!

Each scenario is defined in a Kathará `lab.py` file, which specifies the network topology, devices, and initial configurations. Check [Kathará API Docs](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara/wiki/Kathara-API-Docs) for more details if you want to create your scenarios.

## Network issues

This framework provides a set of predefined issues that can be injected into the network environment. These issues are categorized into different types, each with specific root causes and key signals. By combining the issues with the network scenarios, randomlizing the failure locations, and composing multiple issues, this framework can generate multiple incidents based on a network issue (see # Incident column). The current registry/full CSV contains 55 problem IDs; the compact `benchmark_selected.csv` intentionally selects 54 of them.
The following table summarizes the issues available in this framework:

| Category                               | Root Cause                              | Key Signals                                                     | # Incident |

Based on the above issues, we disclose a large public dataset of AI agents’ behavior for network troubleshooting, with more than 900 reasoning traces. See the [![Zenodo Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zenodo-17971675-blue?logo=zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/17971675).

## MCP Servers and Tools

This framework provides MCP servers under `src/nika/service/mcp_server`. These include:

- **Kathará base MCP server** (`kathara_base_mcp_server.py`): host reachability and diagnostics, including
  - `get_reachability` to ping all pairs of hosts (subset when the lab is large).
  - `ping_pair` to ping between two specific hosts.
  - `iperf_test` to run an iperf test between two hosts.
  - `systemctl_ops` to manage system services (start, stop, restart, status).
  - `get_host_net_config` to retrieve the network configuration of a host.
  - `get_tc_statistics`, `netstat`, `ip_addr_statistics`, `ethtool`, `curl_web_test` for interface and service checks.
  - `cat_file`, `exec_shell`, `exec_shell_dual` to read files or run commands in containers.
- **BMv2 MCP server** (`kathara_bmv2_mcp_server.py`): P4/BMv2 switch interaction, including
  - `bmv2_get_log`, `bmv2_get_counter_arrays`, `bmv2_read_p4_program`, `bmv2_counter_read`.
  - `bmv2_show_tables`, `bmv2_table_dump`, `bmv2_get_register_arrays`, `bmv2_register_read`.
- **FRR MCP server** (`kathara_frr_mcp_server.py`): FRRouting routers, including
  - `frr_get_bgp_conf`, `frr_get_ospf_conf`, `frr_show_running_config`, `frr_show_ip_route`, `frr_exec`.
- **Telemetry MCP server** (`kathara_telemetry_mcp_server.py`): INT/InfluxDB telemetry, including
  - `influx_list_buckets`, `influx_get_measurements`, `influx_count_measurements`, `influx_query_measurement`.
- **Task management MCP server** (`task_mcp_server.py`): agent submissions, including
  - `list_avail_problems` to list injectable root-cause ids.
  - `submit` to write the agent's final detection/localization/RCA answer.
- **Evolved diagnostic toolbox MCP server** (`tool_evolution_mcp_server.py`):
  - `list_evolved_tools` to inspect promoted composites; probationary candidates are opt-in for inspection.
  - `execute_evolved_tool` to run promoted composites over the composable diagnostic primitive allowlist.
  - Selects the library through `NIKA_TOOL_LIBRARY_ID` and the live lab through `NIKA_SESSION_ID`.

💡 More tools are coming soon...

You can also plug in your own MCP servers following the configuration instruction. Look for more MCP servers at [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/).



## Logging and Observability

The built-in ReAct agent (`react`) traces runs with **Langfuse** (LangChain `CallbackHandler`) and **LangSmith** (`langsmith.tracing_context`). The Codex CLI agent (`cli`) streams `codex exec --json` events to the terminal and logs them to `messages.jsonl` in real time. Configure observability keys in `.env` as shown above. See [LangChain Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/callbacks/) for callback details.

Each session directory under `results/{session_id}/` also contains:

- **`events.jsonl`**: pipeline/system events from `nika.utils.logger` (env deploy, fault inject, agent start/end, eval).
- **`messages.jsonl`**: agent conversation and tool traces from `src/agent/utils/loggers.py`.

### Customized Logger

Agent message logging is built on `MessageLogger` in `src/agent/utils/loggers.py`, which writes structured JSONL to `{session_dir}/messages.jsonl`. The LangGraph ReAct path wraps it with `AgentCallbackLogger` (a LangChain `BaseCallbackHandler`); the Codex CLI path calls `MessageLogger` directly from `CodexWorker`. To extend the ReAct path:

```python
from agent.utils.loggers import AgentCallbackLogger

callback = AgentCallbackLogger(agent="diagnosis_agent", session_dir=session_dir)
result = await agent.ainvoke(
    {"messages": messages},
    config={"callbacks": [callback]},
)
```
