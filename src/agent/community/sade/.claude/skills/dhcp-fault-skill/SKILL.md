# DHCP Server-Side Faults

## Direct-evidence requirement

The agent must show direct evidence on the DHCP server before submitting any DHCP fault. Hosts having no IP is downstream — it does NOT prove the DHCP server is the cause.

## Rule out upstream cascade first

A broken path to the DHCP server looks identical to a server-side fault from the affected host's perspective. Before submitting any DHCP fault, confirm the upstream isn't the real cause: the routing / control plane between the affected host and the DHCP server must be healthy, no ACL on the relay path may be dropping lease traffic, and the server itself must be reachable from the host's access gateway or relay. If any of those is broken, the upstream wins.

A host having no IP, an expired lease, or a short `valid_lft` is NOT direct evidence of a DHCP fault by itself — only a dead daemon or a wrong server configuration is.

## Submit on match

When direct evidence on the DHCP server is sufficient AND the upstream cascade has been ruled out, submit. Do not chain extra probes once the family is confirmed.

## Disambiguation

- **DHCP-spoofed vs host-local misconfig.** If the host's wrong gateway/DNS matches what the DHCP server is pushing, this is a DHCP fault and faulty_devices includes both. If the DHCP server's config is correct but the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` or default route differs from what was pushed, that's `host-ip-skill` territory.
- **dhcp_service_down vs no-route-to-DHCP.** A host without IP plus a DHCP server whose process is alive = upstream cascade, not `dhcp_service_down`. The cascade guard above must pass first.
- **`systemctl inactive` is not enough.** `systemctl is-active` may report inactive for services that are actually running under a different init pattern. Combine with `pgrep` (or equivalent process check) to confirm the daemon is actually absent before naming a service-down fault.
- **`dhcp_missing_subnet` vs `dhcp_spoofed_subnet`.** Both produce the same direct evidence (a `subnet` block missing from `dhcpd.conf` for an affected host's subnet). The label follows the scenario's category: `dhcp_missing_subnet` under misconfiguration scenarios, `dhcp_spoofed_subnet` under network-attack scenarios. Check `list_avail_problems()` to see which name is valid for the current scenario before submitting.
