description: Parse oversized MCP tool output. When a tool returns "Output has been saved to <file>.txt" because the result exceeded Claude Code's token limit, run this skill's parser instead of re-reading the file in chunks. Covers `get_reachability` on large topologies and `service_snapshot` on labs with many published hostnames.

# Oversized Tool Outputs

When a tool reports:

```text
Error: result (N characters) exceeds maximum allowed tokens.
Output has been saved to <file_path>.txt
```

Run the parser via the launcher:

```
python h.py parse_large "<file_path>"
```

Auto-detection picks one of three formatters based on payload shape:

- **Reachability**: payload carries `hosts` + `results` (covers both `get_reachability()` and `safe_reachability --json`). The reachability formatter groups failures by source/destination, surfaces clustered suspect destinations, and preserves the host/IP inventory.
- **Service snapshot**: text payload starts with `=== SERVICE SNAPSHOT ===`. The formatter preserves the header (resolver groups, DNS outcome groups, HTTP outcome groups, suspect clients, coverage warnings) and all per-service-device blocks in full, and condenses each per-client block to its nameservers + aggregate flags. The DNS/HTTP outcome groups already aggregate the per-host/per-URL outcomes across clients, so per-zone failure patterns (e.g. one pod's DNS resolves while peers return `no_addresses`) stay visible. To see raw per-row addresses for a single client, rerun `service_snapshot --client <name>` instead of re-reading the saved file.
- **Generic**: any other oversized JSON falls through to a key/structure summary; plain-text payloads are emitted truncated.

Override with `--type reachability`, `--type service_snapshot`, or `--type generic` only if auto-detection picks the wrong formatter.

## Reading the parser output

- Rows missing `tx`, `rx`, `loss_percent`, or `rtt_avg_ms` are NOT healthy — treat as investigation leads.
- If many sources show suspicious rows toward a small destination set, that's a shared-path symptom: check the path or the shared upstream router before blaming the source hosts.
- The parser output is triage guidance, not final proof. Confirm locally before naming a faulty device.
