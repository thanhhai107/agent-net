# SADE — Symptom-Aware Diagnostic Escalation (community agent)

SADE is a methodology-grounded Claude Code agent for the NIKA network-troubleshooting
benchmark. It pairs a **phase-gated diagnostic workflow** (separating evidence
acquisition from hypothesis commitment) with a **15-skill library** that maps symptoms
to confirmation patterns, and plugs into NIKA's standard pluggable-agent interface
(`agent.protocols.TroubleshootingAgent`).

> Built on top of **[NIKA](https://github.com/sands-lab/nika)** — SADE uses NIKA's
> unmodified orchestrator, fault-injection environment, and evaluation pipeline, and
> adds only the agent under this directory.

## Install

SADE drives Claude Code through the Anthropic Agent SDK, declared as an optional extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra sade          # or: pip install -e ".[sade]"
```

Set Anthropic-compatible credentials in the repo-root `.env` (same as
`local_cli.claude_cli`; see [`.env.example`](../../.env.example)):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + optional `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (e.g. DeepSeek)

## Run

```bash
nika agent run -a community.sade -n 20
```

Produces the same session artifacts as the other agents (`messages.jsonl`,
`submission.json`) and submits through NIKA's task MCP server.

```

## How it works

- **Diagnosis** runs inside a single Claude Code session against NIKA's Kathara MCP
  servers. The system prompt enforces five phases (blind start → branch → symptom-first
  diagnosis → broad-search escalation → submission); the skill library and `CLAUDE.md`
  index gate which fault family is entered, and only after a real symptom implicates it.
- **Submission** calls the task MCP server's `submit` tool with the canonical
  `root_cause_name` / `faulty_devices`.
- The skills' read-only helper scripts (`infra_sweep`, `ospf_snapshot`, `bgp_snapshot`,
  …) are invoked through `h.py`, which runs them with the project interpreter and injects
  the active lab name from the running NIKA session.
