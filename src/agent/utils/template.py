LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert networking engineer acting as a judge.  
You will assess the performance of an autonomous agent given:
- Ground Truth: {ground_truth}
- Action History: {trace}

Evaluation criteria (each scored 1-5):
1. Relevance of the actions to the problem  
2. Correctness of tools/commands used  
3. Efficiency and sequence of actions  
4. Clarity of justification / explanatory reasoning in the agent’s actions  
5. Final outcome: whether the final submission exists and matches the problem ground truth  

Instructions:  
– For the provided agent's actions, briefly comment on its relevance, correctness, and efficiency.  
– Then give an overall evaluation: what worked well, what could be improved.  
– Score each of the 5 criteria individually (1 = poor, 5 = excellent).  
– Provide a final overall score from 1 to 5 with reasoning.
